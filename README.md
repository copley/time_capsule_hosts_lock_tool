# Time Capsule Hosts Lock Tool

**Time Capsule Hosts Lock Tool** is a Python 3 terminal utility designed for Ubuntu Linux. It securely locks the system's `/etc/hosts` file, preventing modifications‚Äîeven by root users‚Äîfor a specified duration, effectively creating a time capsule for your hosts configuration.

This tool leverages the Linux immutable file attribute (`chattr +i`) and schedules automatic unlocking with the built-in `at` command. A secure password mechanism allows manual override if necessary.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Immutable Locking**: Locks `/etc/hosts` against changes, deletion, or editing, even by users with root privileges.
- **Time Capsule Lock**: Specify a precise lock duration; the hosts file will auto-unlock at the expiration time.
- **Secure Password Protection**: Password-based override for immediate manual unlocking.
- **Auto-Unlock Scheduling**: Uses Linux's `at` scheduler to automatically unlock when the time capsule expires.
